 1) A variable is a symbolic name that refers to a value. Variables are used to store and manage data in a program

 Variable Naming Rules:

Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).
Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.
Certain words are reserved (keywords) and cannot be used as variable names (e.g., if, while, for, def, etc.).
